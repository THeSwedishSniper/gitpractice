        <li>Git is the industry-standard version control system for web developers</li>
        <li>Use Git commands to help keep track of changes made to a project:</li>
        <li>git init creates a new Git repository</li>
        <li>git status inspects the contents of the working directory and staging area</li>
        <li>git add adds files from the working directory to the staging area</li>
        <li>git diff shows the difference between the working directory and the staging area</li>
        <li>git commit permanently stores file changes from the staging area in the repository</li>
        <li>git log shows a list of all previous commits</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>Before reset:</p>
        <li>HEAD is at the most recent commit</li>
        <p>After resetting:</p>
        <li>HEAD goes to a previously made commit of your choice</li>
        <li>The gray commits are no longer part of your project</li>
        <li>You have in essence rewound the project’s history</li>
        <li>git checkout HEAD filename</li>
        <li>git reset HEAD filename: Unstages file changes in the staging area.</li>
        <li>git reset commit_SHA: Resets to a previous commit in your commit history.</li>
        <p>Additionally, you learned a way to add multiple files to the staging area with a single command:</p>
        <li>git add filename_1 filename_2</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The importance of creating branches and isolating work from the main branch.</li>
        <li>Best practices of naming branches and making commits on branches.</li>
        <li>What a pull request is: a discussion page for a set of code changes between one branch and another.</li>
        <li>Merging a branch and delete it once it’s merged.</li>
