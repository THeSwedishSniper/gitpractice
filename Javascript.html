    <ul class="boxli">
        <li>Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().</li>
        <li>We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.</li>
        <li>There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.</li>
        <li>Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879</li>
        <li>Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'</li>
        <li>The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.</li>
        <li>Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.</li>
        <li>Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().</li>
        <li>We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.</li>
        <li>Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="boxli">
        <li>Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name</li>
        <li>Variables are stored in memory</li>
        <li>The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS</li>
        <li>let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value</li>
        <li>Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined</li>
        <li>Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.</li>
        <li>The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.</li>
        <li>In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.</li>
        <li>The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a value.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="boxli">
        <li>An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true</li>
        <li>if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.</li>
        <li>We can add more conditions using else if statements.</li>
        <li>Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.</li>
        <li>The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.</li>
        <li>The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.</li>
        <li>The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.</li>
        <li>The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.</li>
        <li>A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.</li>
         </ul>
         
        <ul class="boxli">
        <li>A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.</li>
        <li> A function declaration :<img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/declaration.svg"></li>
        <li>A parameter is a named variable inside a function’s block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked:</li>
        <li> <img src= "https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/function_parameters.svg"></li>
        <li>To call a function in your code: <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/name.svg"></li>
        <li>ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through default parameters which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.</li>
        <li>To return a value from a function, we use a return statement.</li>
        <li>To define a function using function expressions: <img src= "https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/expression.svg"></li>
        <li>To define a function using arrow function notation: <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/arrow_notation.svg"></li>
        <li>Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation: <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-javascript-functions/Diagram/return.svg"></li>
        <li>It's good to be aware of the differences between function expressions, arrow functions, and function declarations. As you program more in JavaScript, you’ll see a wide variety of how these function types are used.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.</li>
        <li>Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.</li>
        <li>Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.</li>
        <li>Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.</li>
        <li>Block scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.</li>
        <li>Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.</li>
        <li>Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.</li>
        <li>Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.</li>
        <p>As you continue your coding journey, remember to use best practices when declaring your variables! Scoping your variables tightly will ensure that your code has clean, organized, and modular logic.</p>

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Arrays are created with brackets [].</li>
        <li>Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at 0.</li>
        <li>We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: myArray[0].</li>
        <li>We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like myArray[0] = 'new string';</li>
        <li>Arrays have a length property, which allows you to see how many items are in an array.</li>
        <li>Arrays have their own methods, including .push() and .pop(), which add and remove items from an array, respectively.</li>
        <li>Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as .slice() and .shift(), you can find documentation at the Mozilla Developer Network website.</li>
        <li>Some built-in methods are mutating, meaning the method will change the array, while others are not mutating. You can always check the documentation.</li>
        <li>Variables that contain arrays can be declared with let or const. Even when declared with const, arrays are still mutable. However, a variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.</li>
        <li>Arrays mutated inside of a function will keep that change even outside the function.</li>
        <li>Arrays can be nested inside other arrays.</li>
        <li>To access elements in nested arrays chain indices using bracket notation.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>Loops</p>
        <li>Loops perform repetitive actions so we don’t have to code that process manually every time.</li>
        <li>How to write for loops with an iterator variable that increments or decrements</li>
        <li>How to use a for loop to iterate through an array</li>
        <li>A nested for loop is a loop inside another loop</li>
        <li>while loops allow for different types of stopping conditions</li>
        <li>Stopping conditions are crucial for avoiding infinite loops.</li>
        <li>do...while loops run code at least once— only checking the stopping condition after the first execution</li>
        <li>The break keyword allows programs to leave a loop during the execution of its block</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the benefits of for...of.</li>
        <li>Create a for...of loop from scratch.</li>
        <li>Use a for...of loop to iterate over characters in strings and elements in arrays.</li>
        <li>Use break and continue to control looping in a for...of loop.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Objects store collections of key-value pairs.</li>
        <li>Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.</li>
        <li>An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.</li>
        <li>You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.</li>
        <li>We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.</li>
        <li>We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.</li>
        <li>Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with const.</li>
        <li>Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.</li>
        <li>We can iterate through objects using the For...in syntax.</li>
       
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.</li>
        <li>The this keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.</li>
        <li>Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.</li>
        <li>The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.</li>
        <li>We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.</li>
        <li>JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.</li>
        <li>The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.</li>
        <li>Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.</li>
        <li>Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.</li>
        <li>There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.</li>
        <li>As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Abstraction allows us to write complicated code in a way that’s easy to reuse, debug, and understand for human readers.</li>
        <li>We can work with functions the same way we work with any other type of data, including reassigning them to new variables.</li>
        <li>JavaScript functions are first-class objects, so they have properties and methods like any other object.</li>
        <li>Functions can be passed into other functions as parameters</li>
        <li>A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.</li>
        <li>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</li>
        <li>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</li>
        <li>.findIndex() returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.</li>
        <li>.reduce() iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.</li>
        <li>All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.</li>
        <li>You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).</li>

        <h3>SyntaxError:</h3>
        <li>This error will be thrown when a typo creates invalid code — code that cannot be interpreted by the compiler. When this error is thrown, scan your code to make sure you properly opened and closed all brackets, braces, and parentheses and that you didn’t include any invalid semicolons.</li>
        <h3>ReferenceError:</h3>
        <li>This error will be thrown if you try to use a variable that does not exist. When this error is thrown, make sure all variables are properly declared</li>
        <h3>TypeError:</h3>
        <li>This error will be thrown if you attempt to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, if we tried to use a string method on a number, it would throw a TypeError.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Is your code throwing errors? If so, read the error stack trace for the type, description, and location of the error. Go to the error’s location and try to fix.</li>
        <li>Is your code broken but not throwing errors? Walk through your code using console.log() statements. When unexpected results occur, isolate the bug and try to fix it.</li>
        <li>Did you locate the bug using steps 1 and 2, but can’t fix the bug? Consult documentation to make sure you are using all JavaScript functionality properly. If you are still stuck, Google your issue and consult Stack Overflow for help. Read solutions or post your own Stack Overflow question if none exist on the topic.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes are templates for objects.</li>
        <li>JavaScript calls a constructor method when we create a new instance of a class.</li>
        <li>Inheritance is when we create a parent class with properties and methods that we can extend to child classes.</li>
        <li>We use the extends keyword to create a subclass.</li>
        <li>The super keyword calls the constructor() of a parent class.</li>
        <li>Static methods are called on the class, but not on instances of the class.</li>
        
    </ul>
