        <li>Modern websites require a lot of information from their users and they collect a lot of this information through HTML forms.</li>
        <li>It’s essential to validate the data submitted through forms to keep websites secure and to make sure they function correctly.</li>
        <li>Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define patterns to look for in text. They are an important tool used in validating input.</li>
        <li>Modern HTML comes with useful built-in methods for form validation.</li>
        <li>Custom and complicated client-side validation can be accomplished with JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous requests to the server can perform back-end validations before a form has been submitted.</li>
        <li>A final back-end validation of all data is required to ensure an application’s security and sanitize all data.</li>
    </ul>
