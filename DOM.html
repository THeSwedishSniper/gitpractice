        <li>The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.</li>
        <li>The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.</li>
        <li>Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.</li>
        <li>The DOM also allows access to the attributes of an HTML element such as style, id, etc.</li>
        <p>With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain web pages!</p>>
