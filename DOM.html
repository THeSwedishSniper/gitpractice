        <li>The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to access that page.</li>
        <li>The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document.</li>
        <li>Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements.</li>
        <li>The DOM also allows access to the attributes of an HTML element such as style, id, etc.</li>
        <p>With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain web pages!</p>>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <p>In this lesson, you manipulated a webpage structure by leveraging the Document Object Model (DOM) interface in JavaScript.</p>
        <li>The document keyword grants access to the root of the DOM in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The DOM Interface allows you to select a specific element with CSS selectors by using the .querySelector() method.</li>
        <li>You can access an element directly by its ID with the .getElementById() method which returns a single element.</li>
        <li>You can access an array of elements with the .getElementsByClassName() and .getElementsByTagName() methods, then call a single element by referencing its placement in the array.</li>
        <li>The .innerHTML and .style properties allow you to modify an element by changing its contents or style respectively.</li>
        <li>You can create, append, and remove elements by using the .createElement(),.appendChild() and .removeChild() methods respectively.</li>
        <li>The .onclick property can add interactivity to a DOM element based on a click event.</li>
        <li>The .children property returns a list of an element’s children and the .parentNode property returns the element’s closest connected node in the direction towards the root.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3> event handlers.</h3>
        <li>You can register events to DOM elements using the addEventListener() method.</li>
        <li>The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: an event type and an event handler function.</li>
        <li>When an event is triggered on the event target, the registered event handler function executes.</li>
        <li>Event handler functions can also be registered as values of onevent properties of their event target.</li>
        <li>Event object properties like .target, .type, and .timeStamp are used to provide information about the event.</li>
        <li>The addEventListener() method can be used to add multiple event handler functions to a single event.</li>
        <li>The removeEventListener() method stops specific event handlers from “listening” for specific events firing.</li>
    </ul>
