        <p>In this lesson we went over:</p>
        <li>How mistakes in programming leads to errors.</li>
        <li>Why errors are useful for developers.</li>
        <li>Errors will prevent a program from executing unless it is handled.</li>
        <li>How to create an error using the Error() function.</li>
        <li>How to throw an error object using the throw keyword.</li>
        <li>How to use the try...catch statement to handle thrown errors.</li>
        <li>Evaluating code in a try block to anticipate errors.</li>
        <li>Catching the error in a catch block to allow our program to continue running.</li>
        <li>Why the try...catch statement would be useful in a program.</li>
